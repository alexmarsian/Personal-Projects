# Personal-Projects

This Repo will contain problems from online courses/textbooks in computer science and mathematics that I have completed or am currently working through as part of my endeavour to become a better programmer and scientist. The main themes of courses I am aiming to take are in software engineering (data types, abstraction, algorithms, OO programming, full-stack dev), machine learning and AI, and mathematics (discrete, topics not taken in my undergrad, probability and statistics). 

To keep my undergrad training in genetics and biotech relevant, I am also working through the Rosalind bioinformatics stronghold problem set.
